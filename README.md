here is a project that 

first part: you will generate a pin number which is 4 digit. 
second part: like a calculator, where you can input number.

if your generate pin number and the calculator input number is matched then you are done.
if its not then you have to try again... but you will be able check try 3 times(currently generate pin).
after 3 time left the program will be disabled..
then again you have to generate a new pin ....
